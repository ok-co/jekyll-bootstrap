# Esox lucius

## Description

**Esox lucius**, commonly known as the northern pike, is a species of carnivorous fish of the genus Esox (the pikes). They are typically found in brackish and fresh waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Known for their elongated bodies and sharp teeth, northern pikes are apex predators in their habitats.

## Habitat and Distribution

Northern pikes are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. They inhabit a variety of freshwater environments including lakes, rivers, and marshes. They prefer clear, vegetated waters where they can ambush prey. In Europe, they are found from the British Isles to Eastern Europe, and in North America, they range from Alaska to the upper Midwest and northeastern United States.

## Key Characteristics
### Appearance

Northern pikes have elongated bodies with a duck-bill shaped snout and sharp, needle-like teeth. Their coloration is typically olive green with lighter, yellowish or white bellies. They have distinctive light-colored spots along their bodies and dark, vertical bars on their fins.

### Reproduction

Northern pikes spawn in the spring, typically in shallow, vegetated areas of lakes and rivers. Females lay thousands of adhesive eggs on submerged vegetation. The eggs hatch in about two weeks, and the young pikes grow rapidly, feeding on small invertebrates and fish larvae.

### Diet

Northern pikes are opportunistic predators with a diet that includes fish, amphibians, small mammals, and birds. They rely on their excellent camouflage and quick bursts of speed to ambush prey. Juvenile pikes primarily consume small invertebrates and gradually shift to a fish-based diet as they grow.
